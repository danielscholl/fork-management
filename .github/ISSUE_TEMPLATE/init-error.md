### ‚ùå Invalid Repository Format

The comment `{{comment}}` doesn't match the required format.

Please provide the repository name as `owner/repo`, for example:
```
microsoft/vscode
```

Common mistakes to avoid:
- Don't include the full URL
- Use the exact repository name (case-sensitive)
- Include both the owner and repository name
- No spaces or special characters

Try commenting again with the correct format.
