Initial synchronization with upstream repository.

### BREAKING CHANGE: Initial Content
This brings in the complete upstream codebase which will become our new baseline.

### Changes Included
- Initial sync from upstream's {{default_branch}} branch
- All upstream files and history

### Next Steps
1. Review the changes
2. Merge this PR to populate fork_integration
3. The initialization PR to main can be merged after this one

This ensures fork_integration has the latest upstream content before completing initialization.
