Complete initialization of the fork management system.

### BREAKING CHANGE: Repository Structure
This sets up the initial repository structure and workflows for fork management:

- Created branch structure:
  - fork_upstream: Tracks upstream changes
  - fork_integration: Integration and conflict resolution
  - main: Stable branch with local modifications
- Configured upstream remote tracking
- Initialized GitHub Actions workflows
- Set up release management

### Next Steps
1. First merge the "Initial Sync" PR into fork_integration
2. Then review and merge this PR
3. Test sync workflow by triggering it manually
4. Create a test commit following conventional commits format
5. Monitor CI workflow for validation

### Common Issues
- If sync fails, check UPSTREAM_REPO_URL configuration
- For release issues, verify the .release-please-config.json
- If CI fails, check the validation errors

Please review and merge to complete initialization.
