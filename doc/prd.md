# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview

This PRD describes a Fork Management System—a project designed to help teams maintain long-lived forks of an upstream open-source repository. 
The system is implemented as a template repository with automated setup and management workflows.

When a new repository is created from this template, GitHub Actions automatically:
1. Configure the required branch structure
2. Set up branch protection rules
3. Initialize synchronization with the specified upstream repository
4. Configure release management workflows

The system handles:

- Pulling changes from an upstream repository on a regular basis.
- Integrating new updates into a private fork without disrupting ongoing local development.
- Certifying and releasing stable versions for downstream users or internal consumers.

The main objective is to ensure that any proprietary modifications (or specialized local changes) remain functional and up to date while maintaining alignment with the upstream source.

## 2. Problem Statement

Organizations may maintain private forks of open-source projects for additional features or custom modifications. However:

- Upstream repositories evolve continuously with new features and fixes.
- Local developments in the private fork can conflict with upstream changes, requiring careful integration.
- Downstream users need stable, tested releases of these private forks on a predictable schedule.

### Key Challenge
How can we continuously integrate upstream updates into a private fork while ensuring proprietary code remains intact and providing reliable releases to downstream consumers?

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### Regular Upstream Sync
- Provide an automated or on-demand mechanism to pull changes from the upstream repository on a set schedule (e.g., weekly) or as needed.

### Controlled Integration
- Introduce a dedicated branch for merging and testing new upstream changes before they reach the stable fork master.

### Isolated Feature Development
- Enable teams to develop proprietary or localized features in separate branches without breaking the stable mainline.

### Stable Downstream Release
- Release certified, tested builds to downstream consumers on a predictable cadence.

### Traceable Versioning
- Establish a semantic versioning scheme that references the upstream version or commit for clarity and traceability.

## 4. User Stories

1. As a Fork Maintainer, I need a reliable process to sync upstream changes into my private fork, ensuring that conflicts are resolved early.
2. As a Developer, I want to create feature branches to build proprietary enhancements without affecting the main (master) branch until my changes are ready.
3. As a Downstream Consumer, I require predictable, stable releases from the private fork on a consistent schedule.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Upstream Sync
#### Scheduled or On-Demand Pull
- The system must support fetching updates from the upstream repository at regular intervals or manually when required.

#### Sync Branch
- Maintain a dedicated branch (e.g., fork_upstream) to track upstream changes.

### 5.2 Controlled Integration
#### Integration Branch
- Introduce a staging branch (e.g., fork_integration) where pulled updates are merged and conflicts resolved.

#### Automated Conflict Detection
- Provide tools or processes to quickly identify conflicts and prompt resolution.

### 5.3 Proprietary Feature Development
#### Feature Branches
- Each new feature or proprietary change is developed on its own branch (e.g., Feature1, Feature2) for isolation.

#### Merge to Main
- Completed features merge into the main branch of the private fork when deemed stable.

### 5.4 Downstream Releases
#### Certified Tags
- Tag stable snapshots in the main branch (e.g., v1.2.0) after successful testing and validation.

#### Scheduled Pull
- Downstream consumers or repositories pull these certified tags on a defined schedule (e.g., weekly).

### 5.5 Versioning
#### Semantic Versioning
- Adopt Major.Minor.Patch, incrementing versions based on the scope of changes (breaking, features, or fixes).
- Utilize Release Please for automated version management and changelog generation.
- Follow Conventional Commits specification for commit messages to enable automated versioning.

#### Release Please Integration
- Automatically detect version bumps based on Conventional Commits.
- Generate and maintain CHANGELOG.md files.
- Create release pull requests with version updates.
- Support monorepo configuration if needed.
- Handle upstream version references in release notes.

#### Commit Message Convention
- feat: New feature (minor version bump)
- fix: Bug fix (patch version bump)
- feat!: or fix!: Breaking change (major version bump)
- chore: Maintenance tasks (no version bump)
- docs: Documentation updates (no version bump)
- style: Code style changes (no version bump)
- refactor: Code refactoring (no version bump)
- perf: Performance improvements (patch version bump)
- test: Test updates (no version bump)

#### Upstream Reference
- Append or record the upstream release/commit reference in the version tag (e.g., fork-v1.3.0-upstream-v1.3.0) or include it in the CHANGELOG.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Automation**: Initial repository setup must be fully automated via GitHub Actions
- **Reliability**: Each certified release must pass all relevant tests to ensure quality.
- **Scalability**: The workflow should handle multiple feature branches and frequent upstream merges.
- **Performance**: The integration process should not significantly degrade CI/CD performance.
- **Security**: Proprietary code must remain protected and separated from public visibility where required.
- **Maintainability**: Clear workflows and documentation allow new collaborators to get up to speed quickly.
- **Automation**: Release management and changelog generation must be automated using Release Please.

## 7. Assumptions

1. The upstream repository follows a standard branching and tagging policy (main branch, feature branches, release tags, etc.).
2. Teams have proper permissions to create and manage branches in the private fork.
3. Downstream consumers can integrate new releases on a regular cadence without disruption.
4. Proprietary or local changes can be isolated to feature branches without direct manipulation of the master branch.

## 8. Dependencies

1. GitHub Template Repository functionality
2. GitHub Actions for automation and workflow orchestration
3. GitHub API for branch protection and repository configuration
4. Git Repository Hosting (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) for version control, branching, and pull requests.
5. CI/CD Pipeline for automated builds and test execution.
6. Automation/Orchestration Tools (scripts or workflows) to manage merges, conflict resolution, and tagging.
7. Versioning & Release Management processes for stable, traceable releases.
8. Release Please GitHub Action for automated release management.

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

### Successful Upstream Pull
- A designated sync branch (Fork_Upstream) pulls and tracks upstream commits without impacting the local master.

### Conflict-Resolution Workflow
- Merging upstream changes into the Fork_Integration branch triggers builds/tests to detect conflicts.

### Feature Isolation
- Proprietary features remain on separate branches until merged into master following successful testing.

### Stable Master Branch
- Only conflict-free and tested changes reach Fork Master.

### Regular Downstream Updates
- Certified tags are consistently published for downstream consumption, e.g., on a weekly basis.

### Automated Release Management
- Release Please successfully creates release pull requests based on Conventional Commits.
- CHANGELOG.md is automatically updated with proper categorization of changes.
- Version bumps correctly reflect the nature of changes (major, minor, patch).

## 10. Technical Design Overview

A recommended branching strategy facilitates controlled updates from upstream, isolated proprietary development, and stable releases for downstream.

### 10.1 Upstream Branching Strategy (Generic)
```
┌────────────────┐
│ Upstream Master│ (U0 → U5)
└────────────────┘
      ↑    ↑
   Feature Branches
```
- **Master Branch**: Primary branch with continuous updates from the open-source project.
- **Feature Branches**: Used by the upstream project for new features, fixes, etc.

### 10.2 Fork Branching Strategy
```
             ┌────────────────────────┐
             │ fork_upstream (Sync)   │
             │ (Tracks Upstream)      │
             └────────────────────────┘
                        ↓
             ┌───────────────────────┐
             │ fork_integration      │
             │ (Conflict Resolution) │
             └───────────────────────┘
                        ↓
             ┌───────────────────────┐
             │ fork_main             │
             │ (Stable)              │
             └───────────────────────┘
              ↑                     ↑
        Feature Branches       Certified Tags
        (Feature1, etc.)       (Downstream Pull)
```

- **Fork_Upstream**: Regularly pulls changes from the upstream master.
- **Fork_Integration**: Merges pulled changes, resolves conflicts before updates reach Fork Master.
- **Fork Master**: Maintains the stable, production-ready version.
- **Feature Branches**: Proprietary or localized work, merged into Fork Master upon completion.

### 10.3 Downstream Repository Strategy
```
┌───────────────────────────┐
│ Downstream Main           │
│ (Stable Releases)         │
└───────────────────────────┘
              ↑
     Certified Tags (Weekly)
```
- **Downstream Master**: Maintains stable code, pulling certified releases (tags) from Fork Master.
- **No Direct Feature Development**: Downstream only consumes verified releases.

### 10.4 Complete Fork Flow
```
 ┌─────────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────────┐
 │ Upstream Master     │ ---> │ fork_upstream       │
 │ (U0 → U5)           │      │ (Pull Changes)      │
 └─────────────────────┘      └─────────────────────┘
           ↑                         ↓
 Feature Branches          ┌─────────────────────┐
  (Upstream)               │ fork_integration    │
                           │ (Conflict Resolve)  │
                           └─────────────────────┘
                                    ↓
                           ┌─────────────────────┐
                           │ Fork main           │
                           │ (Stable)            │
                           └─────────────────────┘
                               ↑              ↑
                        Feature Branches  Certified Tags
                        (Proprietary)    (Downstream Pull)
```

**Process Flow**:
1. **Pull from Upstream**: Fork_Upstream fetches updates from Upstream Master.
2. **Merge & Resolve**: Changes merge into Fork_Integration, where conflicts are addressed and tested.
3. **Promote to Master**: Tested changes flow into Fork Master.
4. **Downstream Release**: Certified tags from Fork Master are pulled by downstream on a scheduled or on-demand basis.

## 11. Versioning Strategy

### 11.1 Semantic Versioning with Upstream Reference
Major.Minor.Patch increments to reflect the nature of changes:
- **Major**: Breaking changes.
- **Minor**: New features or minor enhancements.
- **Patch**: Bug fixes or small improvements.
- **Upstream Reference**: Optionally append the upstream release/commit (e.g., fork-v2.0.0-upstream-v1.4.1).

### 11.2 Examples
| Upstream Version | Fork Outcome | Fork Version Tag |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| upstream-v1.2.3 | No breaking changes | fork-v1.2.0-upstream-v1.2.3 |
| upstream-v1.3.0 | Minor updates in fork features | fork-v1.3.0-upstream-v1.3.0 |
| upstream-v1.4.1 | Breaking fork changes | fork-v2.0.0-upstream-v1.4.1 |
| upstream-v1.4.1 | Bug fix in fork only | fork-v2.0.1-upstream-v1.4.1 |

## 12. Testing Requirements

### Branching & Merging
- Validate merges from Fork_Upstream into Fork_Integration for conflict detection and resolution.
- Ensure merges into Fork Master trigger automated builds and tests.

### Feature Branch Isolation
- Confirm that new features remain contained until they are merged to Fork Master post-testing.

### Certification & Tagging
- Each certified release tag must pass a full regression test suite before being published for downstream.

### Version Tag Validation
- Ensure the system enforces correct semantic versioning, optionally referencing the matching upstream version.

## 13. Linting and Code Quality Requirements

- **Static Analysis**: All scripts or automation tools must pass standard linters (e.g., Flake8, ESLint) based on the chosen language.
- **Continuous Integration**: New merges require passing tests in a CI pipeline (style, unit tests, coverage).
- **Documentation & Comments**: Complex processes or scripts must be thoroughly documented for maintainability.

## 14. Documentation Testing

- **Branching Diagrams**: Verify diagrams match the actual repo structure and branching setup.
- **Usage Guides**: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for maintainers and contributors on how to merge, resolve conflicts, and tag releases.
- **Examples**: Demonstrate real-world scenarios for merging upstream changes, tagging stable releases, and addressing conflicts.
- **Changelog Consistency**: Each version's upstream reference and changes must be clearly recorded.

## 15. Conclusion

This Fork Management System enables continuous alignment with an upstream open-source project while preserving local, proprietary changes. By maintaining a sync branch and an integration branch, users can effectively isolate and test upstream merges before committing updates to the stable master.

Additionally, version tagging ensures downstream consumers receive predictable, stable releases. The result is a highly maintainable fork that benefits from the latest open-source contributions without jeopardizing unique local modifications.
